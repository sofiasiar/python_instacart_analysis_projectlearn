# Instacart Sales Analysis and Customer Segmentation

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Instacart's sales data, aimed at uncovering customer behavior patterns and informing targeted marketing strategies.  The goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing habits and demographics to optimize marketing campaigns and drive sales growth.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze Instacart's sales data to understand customer variety and purchasing behaviors.  This analysis will support the development of a targeted marketing strategy, ensuring the right customer profiles are reached with the appropriate products.

## Context

Instacart has a successful online grocery business, but seeks to further understand its customer base and optimize sales.  Stakeholders believe a targeted marketing approach will be more effective than a one-size-fits-all strategy.  This analysis will provide insights into customer segmentation possibilities based on provided criteria.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis will be described in detail within the Jupyter Notebook(s) included in this repository.  This description will include:

*   Data source
*   Data structure (e.g., CSV, database)
*   Variables included (e.g., customer demographics, order history, product information)
*   Data size and any preprocessing steps taken.
